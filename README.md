# Emotion Detector
This project implements an **NLP-based Emotion Detector** that classifies emotions from text.
## Overview
- The notebook trains and evaluates a natural language processing (NLP) model for emotion classification.
- **Refined dataset is already included in the notebook**, so users can start running the notebook from the **"Enhancing and Refining the Dataset"** step.
- Users **do not need `old_emotiondataset.csv`** or any external dataset. Everything required to run the notebook is self-contained.
## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter** or **Google Colab**.
2. **Run the first two cells** to install necessary libraries and import packages.
3. Then run cells starting from **"Enhancing and Refining the Dataset"**.
4. The notebook will run seamlessly and produce the trained model and outputs.
